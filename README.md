# PYTHON-GEA3-TOOL

Protocol GEA3 in Python and LabVIEW to adquire data from the appliance.

## Advantages
- With this program you don't need use the pink bean or green bean. You only need use a USB-TTL. So this program helps to reduce cost.
- You can edit like you want and helps to create a own program for a specific project.
- You can automatize test without TestStand using LabVIEW and Python.
- You can use a JSON file to see the data in text.

## Disadvantages
- You need create a harness to conect RJ45 to USB-TTL.
- If the MC is not isolated, you need to use a isolator.

## Considerations
If you want use a LabVIEW proyect with Python, you need to use a specific version of Python and LabVIEW.
